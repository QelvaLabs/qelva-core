# Qelva Core Docs

This folder contains technical and privacy documentation for the Qelva stack.

Planned structure:

- `privacy/` — threat model, metadata analysis, relayer trust model
- `architecture/` — high-level architecture and module boundaries
- `flows/` — identity, intents, relayer, automation flows

For now, the focus is on **privacy** and **threat modelling**.
