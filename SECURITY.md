# Security Policy

Qelva Core is a **privacy-native** and **non-custodial** system.  
We take security reports seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately.

Temporary contact (beta phase):

- Email (placeholder): security@qelva.io

When reporting, include:

- Description of the issue
- Impact (what can an attacker do)
- Steps to reproduce
- Any suggested mitigations

Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Data We Do Not Want

By design, Qelva Core should **not** store or log:

- Seed phrases or private keys
- Raw PIN values
- Unencrypted mnemonics
- Full user transaction history tied to real-world identity

If you find any code or behaviour that contradicts this, that is a bug.
